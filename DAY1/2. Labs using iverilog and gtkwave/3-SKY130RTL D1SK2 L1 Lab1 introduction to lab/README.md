# Setting Up the Sky130 RTL Design and Synthesis Workshop

This guide will help you set up the **Sky130 RTL Design and Synthesis Workshop** repository on your Ubuntu system.

## Step 1: Create a New Directory
Navigate to your home directory and create a folder where you will store the project files.

```bash
cd /home                  # Navigate to home directory
mkdir VLSI                # Create a new directory for the workshop
cd VLSI                   # Enter the new directory
````

## Step 2: Clone the Repository

Use Git to clone the workshop repository from GitHub. This will download all required files.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kunalg123/sky130RTLDesignAndSynthesisWorkshop.git
```

This will create a folder named **`sky130RTLDesignAndSynthesisWorkshop`** inside your `VLSI` directory.

## Step 3: Verify the Clone

Check that the repository has been successfully cloned.

```bash
ls
```

You should see:

```
